## Abstract
Our research aims to develop a legal question and answer system called "Law at hand" to solve the embarrassing problem that professional lawyers are few and expensive when people face legal problems in their daily lives. We have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the existing legal question and answer system, and trained the model by using a data set containing 200 basic legal questions and answers. The front-end interface design focuses on user friendliness and ease of use. The back-end system integrates the powerful zhipuAI glm4 model, which can handle complex legal issues. It also provides accurate and human-like answers, and the system is deployed on the Render platform to ensure the stability and continuous integration and deployment capability of the system. Eventually, users can access the system from their mobile phones at any time and use the QR code scanning function to easily consult legal questions. To meet the specific needs of users in work-related legal matters.
